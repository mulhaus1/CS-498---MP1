# This is the ReadMe for MP1 - To Do List

For this project, I attempted two additional features: animations and import/export to a simple format (JSON)

For code quality, I followed the Jquery Core style guidelines.

I used a few references for jQuery and CSS styling:

- JQuery UI page: http://jqueryui.com/
- CSS Tutorial - http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listutorial/sub_master.htm

That's about it!
